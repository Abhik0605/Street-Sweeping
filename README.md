# Street-Sweeping
Repo for street sweeping using OR tools

This project is different from the usual applications of the OR-Tools routing solver. A typical vehicle routing problem requires guiding a vehicle optimally from destination to destination. In contrast, street sweeping is an edge covering problem. The edge of the street is literally being covered by the street sweeperâ€™s brooms. Instead of visiting a countable set of addresses, the goal is to visit all the streets using an efficient path.
